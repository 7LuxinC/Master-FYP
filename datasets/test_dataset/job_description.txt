A Java Developer is a software engineer who builds and maintains applications using the Java programming language, often working on web or enterprise systems. They typically use frameworks like Spring Boot and Hibernate, write clean and efficient code, and collaborate with teams to deliver scalable solutions. Key skills include core Java programming, basic web development (JSP, HTML, CSS), database interaction using SQL and JDBC, and version control with Git. Strong problem-solving and communication abilities are also essential for success in Agile environments.
